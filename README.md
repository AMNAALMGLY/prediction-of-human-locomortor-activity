# uploaded in this repositery a list of codes & function used for a project for the recognition of human locomotor activities using different Ml models , the data first denoised, segmented , features extracted & selected & finally fed to the "parameter tuned" models.
the code for every step mentioned above is included.
link to data used :https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2018.00014/full
path variable is set according to where we downloaded the data on PC
GP_Full_Code && GP_Full_Functions are the 2 main final codes for the project
the paper will be published soon & when it will , we will attach the link here
other codes are used for the single steps of building models starting with Denoise , FeaturExtraction , FeatueSelection till AlgorithImplementation.
