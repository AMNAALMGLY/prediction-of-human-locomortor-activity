Uploaded in this repositery a list of codes & functions used for a Study of using different Ml models/methods for the recognition of human locomotor activities from wearable sensor. The objective was to investigae the suitability of some models/methods/features over the others by measures of performances metrices. The data was first denoised, segmented , then features  were extracted & selected & finally fed to the "parameter tuned" models.       

The code for every step mentioned above is included.

Link to data used :https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2018.00014/full .

Path variable is set according to where we downloaded the data on PC .

GP_Full_Code && GP_Full_Functions are the 2 main final codes for the project.

The paper will be published soon & when it will , we will attach the link here.

The other codes are used for the single steps of building ML models starting with Denoise , FeaturExtraction , FeatueSelection till AlgorithImplementation.
